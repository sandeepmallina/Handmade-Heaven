### Technology Used
I have used **React** for the frontend of my app. React is a JavaScript library that makes it easy to build user interfaces. It is declarative, meaning that I describe what I want the UI to do, rather than how to do it. This makes React code more readable and maintainable. React is also highly performant, making it a good choice for building high-traffic web applications.
<br>

I have used **NodeJs** to build the backend of my app. NodeJs is a JavaScript runtime environment that runs on the server. It is open source, fast, and scalable. NodeJs made it easy to build a reliable and performant backend for my app.
<br>

I have used **Netlify** serverless functions to run small, event-driven tasks in my app. Netlify serverless functions are a good choice for running these types of tasks because they are scalable, reliable, and cost-effective.

## Deployment Process
I have used GitHub and Netlify to deploy this site. By using GitHub and Netlify, I was able to make the deployment process easy and efficient.
This site was built using Netlify [Deployed site](https://handmade-heaven.netlify.app/).

## Concepts of ReactJs Used 

I have used Context API and Hooks to pass data to child and parent components in a way that is both efficient and easy to maintain. Context API provides a way to share data between components without having to pass props down manually. Hooks provide a way to use state and other React features in functional components. By using Context API and Hooks, I was able to create a more maintainable and efficient codebase.

Context API allows me to share data between components without having to pass props down manually. This makes it easy to update the data in one place and have it be reflected in all of the components that use it. Hooks allow me to use state and other React features in functional components. This makes my code more concise and easier to read.
